<!-- Replication reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects.  These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

##Introduction

R Script Instruction: [No abstract is needed.]  Each replication project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and results.  These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of data collection.  Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information.  It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  

Canvas Instruction: The introduction section will be slightly different if you are doing a reproducibility project; please complete everything under the Introduction heading of the reproducibility project template.

### The original study
This study examined how time horizon (unspecified, expanded, or constrained) influence the motivation (demonstrated by choice from three work-related activities) of older and younger workers (age measured as a continuous variable).

### Justification
Canvas Instruction: A short justification for your choice of experiment in terms of your research interests or research program (1 paragraph). This justification should tell us why you chose this particular result – this section is especially important if you are choosing a result outside of the standard Prolific/Psych Sci model.

This paper is the latest publication (July 2022) from my lab that I am really intrigued by. It is along my line of research -- age, motivation, and prosociality. Additionally, it has a similar type of design as my intended first-year project (also potentially a life-span sample divided into three experimental conditions). I have never conducted a study with this type of design, so I hope to use this class project to practice for my own data collection and analysis. 

### Stimuli, procedures, challenges
Canvas Instruction: A description of the stimuli and procedures that will be required to conduct this experiment, and what the challenges will be (1-2 paragraphs).

Participants will first provide background information, which includes age, gender, race, household income, educational level, subjective health, future time perspective (10-item questionnaire), and big five personality (10-item questionnaire). Then, they are randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions where time horizons at work were unspecified, expanded, or constrained. Each condition includes a brief manipulation prompt, which had been validated in the original study. After reading the prompt, we ask participants in each condition to choose one of three work-related activities, each of which represent pursuit of a different type of goal. 

I think this may be a 10-20 minutes questionnaire. Once I make the Qualtrics survey and find out if it's too long, I can maybe cut some background information. I have never used Prolific and I am not sure if it's easy to recruit older adults there. The original paper has a sample of 555 adults aged 20 to 75 (M = 44.65, SD = 13.2). I hope to be able to recruit a sample that matches with this age distribution. Another challenge is to recruit enough people for the experiment... but I care more about the process of learning than the results! I also have to recruit only people who have a full-time or part-time job. I am not sure if these conditions could be specified in the recruitment material. My main challenge is that I don't know anything about Prolific because I did mostly in-person physio experiments in the past! I am excited to learn though!

### Links
Canvas Instruction: A link to the repository and to the original paper (as hosted in your repo). The goal is that we should be able to click on these links and review that your repo is formatted right and look at the original paper.

Below is untouched methods, results, and discussion sections

##Methods

###Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

###Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

###Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

###Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


##Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
###Data Preparation

####Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

####Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
